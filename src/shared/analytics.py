"""
Aggregation queries behind the staff-facing clinic dashboard (see
app/dashboard.py). Kept in its own module, separate from shared/db.py's
one-row-at-a-time CRUD queries, since these are read-only reporting
queries that combine several tables at once.

Like the rest of shared/, these functions run against whichever database
shared/db.get_db_path() currently resolves to. The caller (app/dashboard.py)
is responsible for calling shared.db.set_current_db_path(clinic["db_path"])
first, exactly the way a ClinicWorker does -- because that's a
contextvars.ContextVar, one FastAPI request reading clinic A's dashboard can
never see clinic B's data, even if both are requested at the same instant.

What counts as "this period" throughout: conversations by their started_at,
appointments by when they were BOOKED (created_at) -- not appointment_time,
which is the future slot the patient is booked into -- and patients by when
they first messaged (created_at). Rows written before these created_at
columns existed are NULL and are excluded from period-based counts rather
than guessed at; see the migration notes in shared/db.py.

    Builds everything the staff dashboard shows, in one call: top-line KPIs,
    today's live schedule, conversations needing staff attention, a recent
    conversations feed (including patients who reached out but never
    booked), the most-requested services, message volume by hour of day,
    a conversation-outcomes breakdown, and a 6-month conversation-volume
    trend -- all scoped to the last `days` days, or all-time if `days` is
    None.

    name_filter / date_from / date_to narrow the two conversation LISTS
    only (needs_attention, recent_conversations) -- they never affect the
    KPI numbers or the insight charts, which stay scoped to `days`.
    date_from/date_to (each "YYYY-MM-DD", either or both) pick an exact day
    (set both to the same date) or an inclusive range, and OVERRIDE the
    `days` scope for those two lists -- a clinic can have thousands of
    conversations, so a day/range pick is exact rather than a coarse
    monthly bucket. With no date given, name_filter searches the patient's
    ENTIRE history rather than just the current `days` window -- a name
    search that silently came back empty just because the match happened
    to fall outside "last 7 days" is a search that doesn't work.

    This does more, smaller queries than a single giant SQL statement would
    need -- deliberately, so each piece stays readable and easy to adjust as
    the dashboard grows, rather than one query trying to do everything at
    once. Clinic-scale data (dozens to low hundreds of conversations per
    period) makes this a non-issue performance-wise.

    schedule_date ("YYYY-MM-DD", optional) picks which single day's
    appointments the schedule section shows -- defaults to today when
    absent/malformed. Independent of every other filter on this page: it's
    a "what does tomorrow look like" lookup, not a report window.
