"""
Loads the clinic's editable settings from config/clinic_config.yaml —
services & prices, general hours, parking, phone, holidays, and the list
of dentists.

Non-developers edit config/clinic_config.yaml directly to change any of
this; this module just reads that file so the rest of the app can use it.
The file is re-read fresh each time it's requested (see note on caching
below), so edits take effect the next time the app is started.
